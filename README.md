I'm Rajat, interested in computer networks and website development with a special interest in internet protocols. I'm comfortable with writing code in  C and Python and have used javascript frameworks to build websites. I've done my bachelor's in Computer science and Engineering in 2019 and wanted to enter the research domain. I'm pursuing my master's in Western Michigan University in batch of 2025. I want to build my profile so as to once work for Cisco in there research wing.
